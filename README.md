In January 2016 when I was looking a new job I got one month-term contract to create a 3D welded assembly of small airport vehicle from metal sheets. The submitter was IMPACT INDUSTRY BRNO, a.s., mid-size Czech manufacturing company with around 150 employees. They obtained a order to help a R&D centre of TLD with development. That involves build a welded chassis for the verification assesment. My main task was create 3D CAD data in Solid Works for next processing as NC code for laser cutting machine or roll forming machine. The original documentation by TLD was based just on 2D drawings in pdf format. During my effort I found several problems as collisions and deviation of required tolerance. By this, I had to make several upgrade suggestions and consulted these with TLD.

The TLD is French company who deals with development and manufacturing ground vehicles and equipment for airports. For instance, ground power unit, belt loaders for suitcases, trailers and baggage tractors.
