In January 2016 when I was looking for a new job I got a short-term contract to create a 3D welded assembly of a small airport vehicle from metal sheets. The submitter was  IMPACT INDUSTRY BRNO, a.s. - a mid-size Czech manufacturing company with around 150 employees. They received an order to help an R&D centre of TLD with development. That involves constructing a welded chassis for the verification assessment. My main task was to create 3D CAD data in Solid Works for the next processing as NC code for a laser cutting machine or a roll forming machine. The original documentation by TLD was based on just 2D drawings in pdf format. During my efforts I found several problems as collisions and deviations from the required tolerance. Consenquently, I had to make several upgrade suggestions and consulted these with TLD.

The TLD is a French company which deals with development and manufacturing ground vehicles and equipment for airports. For instance, ground power units, belt loaders for suitcases, trailers and baggage tractors.
